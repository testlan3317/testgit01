1. How to install xRDP on Ubuntu 20.04?
xRDP is an open-source implementation of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that allow you to graphically control a remote
system. 
Ubuntu servers are managed from the command line and do not have a desktop environment installed by default. if you run the desktop
version of Ubuntu, skip this step.

There are various desktop environments available in Ubuntu repositories that you can choose. 
One option is to install Gnome, which is the default desktop environment in Ubuntu 20.04. 
Another is to install Xfce. It is a fast,stable, and lightweight desktop environment, which makes it ideal for usage on a remote
server.

- install Gnome
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop

- install Xfce
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop

Installing Xrdp: Xrdp is included in the default Ubuntu repositories. To install it
- install xRDP
  $ sudo apt install xrdp

Once the installation is complete, the Xrdp service will automatically start. You can verify it by typing:
  $ sudo systemctl status xrdp

By default Xrdp uses the /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key file gthat is readable only by members of the "ssl-cert" group. 
Run the following command to add the xrdp users to the group:
  $ sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert

Restart the Xrdp service for changes to take effect:
  $ sudo systemctl restart xrdp

That's it. 

Important Xrdp configuraiton:
The xrdp configuraiton files are located in the /etc/xrdp folder. For basic xrdp connections, you do not need to make any changes
to the configuraiton files. 

xrdp.ini: The main configuration file. This file is divided into sections and allows you to set global configuration settings
such as security and listening addresses and create different xrdp login sessions. 
Note: whenever you make any changes to the configuration file, you need to restart the xrdp service. 

startwm.sh: xrdp uses startwm.sh file to launch the X session. If you want to use another X window desktop, edit this file. 

Configuring Firewall:
The xrdp daemon listens on port 3389 on all interfaces. If you run a firewall on your Ubuntu server. you'll need to open the xrdp
ports.

To allow access to the Xrdp server from a specific IP address or IP range, for example, 192.168.33.0/24, you would run:
  $ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.33.0/24 to any port 3389

if you want to allow access from anywhere (which is highly discouraged for security reasons), run:
  $ sudo ufw allow 3389

For increased security, you may consider setting up Xrdp to listen only on localhost and creating an SSH tunnel that securely
forwards traffic from your local machine on port 33890 to the server on the same port. 

Normally issues after install the xRDP, you will see the pop up window to ask your authentication as below:

1. Authentication Required: Authentication is required to create a color managed device. 
2. Then another popup will show up again displaying Authentication required message. (it depends based on the situations)

The behavior explained:
Ubuntu is using the PolKit software component. 
Polkit is basically an application authorization framework that will capture actions performed by a user and check if this user
is authorized to perform such action on the system.

Polkit reads some policy files that will specify if the user requested by the user is authorized, not authorized or
need authentication. Polkit provides a way to implement granular authorization to users based on the action requested.

when you perform login on Ubuntu and the popup appears, it simply means that the Polkit Policy file for this action cannot be
performed without authentication first. Now, if you logon locally on the system, no popup are displayed because Polkit 
application has evaluated that this action does not need authentication. This means that Polkit can differentiate between a local
session and a remote session. This also means that different authorization policies applies for local sessions and remote sessions.

Solution:

Create color manager policy

Create a file: /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/45-allow.colord.pkla

Paste the following content:

[Allow Colord all Users]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.color-manager.create-device;org.freedesktop.color-manager.create-profile;org.freedesktop.color-manager.delete-device;org.freedesktop.color-manager.delete-profile;org.freedesktop.color-manager.modify-device;org.freedesktop.color-manager.modify-profile
ResultAny=no
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes

Create package manager policy

create a file /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/46-allow-update-repo.pkla

Paste the following content:

[Allow Package Management all Users]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.packagekit.system-sources-refresh
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=yes
ResultActive=yes

Create Network manager Wifi Scan policy (this may or may not needed)

create a file: /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/47-allow-wifi-scan.pkla

Paste the following content:

[Allow WiFi Scan all Users]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wifi.scan
ResultAny=no
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes
