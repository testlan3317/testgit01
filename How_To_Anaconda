How to install Anaconda on Ubuntu 20.04
Anaconda is a popular Python/R data science and machine learning platform, used for large-scale data processing, predictive
analytics, and scientific computing. 

Anaconda distribution ships with 250 open-srouce data packages, and more than 7500 additional packages can be installed from 
the Anacoda repositories. It also includes the "conda" command-line tool and a desktop graphical user interface called
"Anaconda Navigator".

Installing Anaconda 
Before downloading the installer script, visit the Download page and check if there is a new version of Anaconda for Python3 
available for download.

complete the following steps:

- Anaconda Navigator is a QT-based GUI. If you are installing Anaconda on a desktop machine and you want to use the GUI
application, install the following packages. Otherwise, skip this step.

$sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-glx libegl1-mesa libxrandr2 libxrandr2 libxss1 libxcursor1 libxcomposite1 libasound2 libxi6 libxtst6

- Download the Anaconda installation script with your web browser or wget:

$wget -P /tmp https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

- This step is optional, but it's recommended to verify the data integrity of the script. 
Use the "sha256sum" command to display the script checksum:

$sha256sum /tmp/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

The output should look like this:

2b9f088b2022edb474915d9f69a803d6449d5fdb4c303041f60ac4aefcc208bb  /tmp/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

Make sure the hash printed from the command above matches the one available at the Anaconda with Python3 on 64-bit Linux page
for your appropriate Anaconda version.

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/hashes/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh-hash/

- Run the script to start the installtion process:

$bash /tmp/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

You should see an output like the following:

Welcome to Anaconda3 2020.02

In order to continue the installation process, please review the license
agreement.
Please, press ENTER to continue
>>>

Press Enter to continue. 
Do you approve the license terms? [yes|no]
Type "yes" to accept the license and you'll be prompted to choose the installation location:

Anaconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home/linuxize/anaconda3

    - Press ENTER to confirm the location
    - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
    - Or specify a different location below

The default locaiton should be fine for most users. Press Enter to confirm the location. 

Once the installation is completd, the script will ask you whether you want to run "conda init". Type yes

Installation finished.
Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3
by running conda init? [yes|no]

This will add the command line tool "conda" to your system's PATH.

To activate the Anacoda installation, you can either close and re-open your shell or load the new PATH environment variable
into the current shell session by typing:

$ source ~/.bashrc

Updating Anaconda:
Updating the Anaconda is a pretty straight forward process:

$ conda update --all

If there are updates, conda will display a list and prompt you to confirm the update:

The following packages will be UPDATED:

  anaconda-navigator                          1.9.12-py37_0 --> 1.9.12-py37_1
  conda                                        4.8.2-py37_0 --> 4.8.3-py37_0
  conda-package-han~                   1.6.0-py37h7b6447c_0 --> 1.6.1-py37h7b6447c_0


Proceed ([y]/n)?

It is good idea to update your Anaconda installation regularly.

Uninstalling Anaconda
If you want to uninstall Anaconda from your Ubuntu system, remove the Anaconda installation directory and all other files that
have been created during the installation:

$ rm -rf ~/anaconda3 ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum

Open the ~/.bashrc file and remove the Anaconda directory from the PATH environment variable:

# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/home/linuxize/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/home/linuxize/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/home/linuxize/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/home/linuxize/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<

Normal issue: there is no icon on the panel at Ubuntu 20.04. 

so we have to create a file (anaconda.desktop) to link the icon
create a file: ~/.local/share/applciations/anaconda.desktop
content as below:
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=Anaconda
Exec=/home/yourusername/anaconda3/bin/anaconda-navigator
Icon=/home/yourusername/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/anaconda_navigator/app/icons/Icon1024.png
Terminal=false

Then, you will see the icon at the applications panel
